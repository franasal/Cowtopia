I am Nandi, the bull-headed god of Hinduism. 
I am a reminder that all creatures, regardless of their species,
 are worthy of our compassion and respect.

The world is in chaos. 
People are cruel to animals, and the environment is being destroyed. 
But you can change that! 

You can show the world what it means to be compassionate and respectful.
You can help to create a world where all creatures can live in peace and harmony.
I will be your mentor on this quest. \n  I will help you to develop the skills and
the courage that you need to succeed as a vegan activist.
